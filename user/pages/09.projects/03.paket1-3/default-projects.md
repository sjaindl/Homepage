In my spare time I love to play football. I'm actually actively playing at the hobby football club HV TDP Stainz, and I have created the club homepage [https://www.hvtdpstainz.at](https://www.hvtdpstainz.at).

It supports the following features/has the following pages:
* Landing page with latest news and visitor count
* News Page with accordion and pagination
* Team and championship page
* Photo gallery and video gallery pages
* Donations pages
* About us/Contact pages
* Fanshop
* Membership and document pages

The homepage is written in Typescript using the Angular framework. It uses a MySQL database, where communication is done via PHP. All pages are based on Angular material design.
