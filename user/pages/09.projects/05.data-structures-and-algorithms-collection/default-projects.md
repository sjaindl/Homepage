I had the pleasure to meet the famous Linus Torvalds, founder of Linux, at Google Summer of Code Reunion 2014 in San Jose, California.
As he once said, "bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."

I totally agree with him and that's why I have created a collection of data structures and algorithms. The package is written in Swift. It includes well-known data structures and algorithms such as Djikstra's shortest path algorithm, as well as algorithms for specific problems such as checking whether a string contains all unique characters. Each data structures and algorithm class also has a corresponding unit test with, if applicable, a link to test data/further decription.

The package is available on Swift Package Manager and the repository can be checked out on my github page: [https://github.com/sjaindl/DataStructuresAlgs](https://github.com/sjaindl/DataStructuresAlgs).

Besides various basic as well as advanced data structures, the package offers algorithms of the following areas:
* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Graphs
* Bit Manipulation
* Recursion and Dynamic Programming
* Sorting & Searching
* Threading

Algorithms are based on the questions of the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" from Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

I also have an algorithms collection written in Phyton, that can be checked out [here](https://github.com/sjaindl/DatastructuresAlgorithmsNanodegree).
