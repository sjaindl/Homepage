A friend of me are passionate football players, and we play both at the hobby football club HV TDP Stainz. Out of that passion the idea of a comunio-like football manager website for hobby leagues was born.

I have created that Single Page Web App written in Angular called "Football Manager". We are using the website club-internally - and it makes much fun to have our own Football Manager :)

It supports the following features:
* OAuth authentication flow via Facebook, Google and E-Mail
* Possibility to create and join leagues
* Transfer market to buy and sell players (values based on player performance/points)
* Scoring system
* Live table
* Profile page
* Admin Area for scoring and statistics


 The app uses Firebase Cloud Firestore as database and communication via REST API to the backend. 

If you want to take a closer look or even start playing you can check out the website [here](https://starting-eleven-2019.firebaseapp.com/contact).
