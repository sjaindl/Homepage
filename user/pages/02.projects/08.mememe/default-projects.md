MemeMe is an iOS app written in Swift. It is a funny photo editor that allows users to create and share Memes with friends. Photos can be added either from an album or from the camera and customized with a top and a bottom text. The resulting Meme can then be shared or saved. It can also be reviewed later in a Meme overview (the overview can be switched between a TableView and a CollectionView) as well as in detail when tapping a Meme in the overview.
