From 2011 to 2018 I've worked actively for the Open Source project "Catrobat", where I also have written my Software engineering Bachelor's thesis as well as Master's thesis at Graz University of Technology. Mainly I have worked on the Android app ("Pocket Code"), which is available on Google Play for Education, but also partly on the iOS versions and on the website (based on Symfony). 

The vision of Catrobat is to develop solutions which inspire especially childs and teenagers to learn coding, get creative and be prepared for the digital world of our future. The founder of Catrobat, Prof. Wolfgang Slany, explains it here:

One of the coolest features I've implemented for Catrobat was the create@school project. It is a standalone Android app (actually a newly introduced gradle product flavor of "Pocket Code") which was especially targeted at educational environments. It was allowing 600+ children in five Austrian, Spanish and British schools to develop digital games on mobile devices linked to their school curriculum. 

Technically I've introduced flavouring with gradle to "Pocket Code" with the create@school app, allowing additions such as complex template projects downloaded via Web Service.
